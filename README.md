# Data Structures and Algorithms University Project

This repository contains the project completed as part of the **"Data Structures and Algorithms"** course at Technical University of Crete. The project focuses on comparing the performance of different search structures, including tree-based structures and linear hashing, both in memory (RAM) and on disk. The goal is to analyze and understand the efficiency of these data structures in various scenarios.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of four different search structures:
1. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A standard binary search tree.
3. **B-Tree**: A balanced tree structure optimized for disk access.
4. **Linear Hashing**: A dynamic hashing technique for efficient data storage and retrieval.

The project also involves reading numerical data from files and evaluating the performance of these structures in both RAM and disk-based scenarios.
